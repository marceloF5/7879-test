# 7879 Frontend Test

Thanks for your interest in the front end role at 7879.
This task will be used as a test of your skills, but also should be fun to develop.
We are using tailwindcss as a css styling utility library, but feel free to use whatever you are comfortable with.
Feel free to add any other libraries you feel would make your life easier

## Time Allowance

Please timebox 1-2 hours (or however much you are comfortable with) this is not intended to be completed as we will
pick-up with you and pair on extending where you have left off.

## Repo Structure

```

components: A place to put components
pages: nextjs pages
public: css/js to be served via next
types: types for APIs which have been pre-built
util: utilities which map datafeed data and api calls to a simple interface

## Goal

The goal is to implement a user portfolio using a test API (which has been integrated in the utilities folder) already

We have provided a base nextjs project which should get you going - however if you wish to throw the whole thing away, then please do.

Your goal is to implement the following figma design in a simple app using simulated "real" data from an api not too disimilar to our own.
